# hello-World
Ideas, resources, sharing, and discussing.
I have taken a C++ class in high school that I don't remember.
I am very interested in learning Python but feel like I never can make the time for it.
I am currently taking a Intro to Programming class to start a CS minor in college. The language we are learning this semester is Java.
